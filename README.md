# Mergesort-Visualization--Tutorial
Created a merge sort tutorial with Reactjs as frontend framework and MYSQL as backend database.
The Story: 
As a new player, I want to learn how to play the game so that I can learn about sorting algorithms and have fun. 
The definition of done (acceptance test): Level one is complete with an easily understood tutorial for how the game’s systems work so that the player can start gaming. 
User Story Algorithm Steps: The Story: As a new player, I want to be able to keep track of the steps in the algorithm so that I can better understand the algorithmic process. The definition of done (acceptance test): Level two is complete when the player can correctly rearrange the numbers, matching each step in the algorithm appropriately with the corresponding number. 
User Story Attempts: The Story: As a player I want to make no more than 3 mistakes at each level so that I do not go back to the previous level. The definition of done (acceptance test): The player moves onto the next level, does not go back to the previous level and the game is not restarted 
User Story: User Feedback The Story: As a player, I want to receive visual and audio feedback on my inputted answers so that I can Group 33 Sprint 0 know if my given answer is right or wrong. The definition of done (acceptance test): The player will see and hear an alert when their answer is submitted 
User Story Evaluation The Story: As a player, I want to see how many of the steps I complete are correct so that I can evaluate how well I understand the sorting algorithm. The definition of done (acceptance test): I will know this is complete if I can see my score after submitting an exercise. 
User Story Larger Levels: The Story: As a player, I want to be able to play similarly styled levels at a larger scale so that I can test the knowledge I’ve acquired so far. The definition of done (acceptance test): This will be completed in levels 4 and 5. They are designed like levels 1, 2, and 3 but have a larger array of values to sort through, allowing the player to test themselves with a larger batch of numbers. 
User Story Visual and Auditory cues: The Story: As a player, I want to receive different visual and auditory cues depending on the feedback given to me for correct or incorrect responses on each exercise so that Its easier and more immediate to identify whether or not i'm right. The definition of done (acceptance test): This will be completed if I can see a difference in the feedback between correct and incorrect and if I can easily identify which feedback is for which of these options. 
User Story Custom Level: The Story: As a player, I want to choose the number of numbers and its range so I can create my own Group 33 Sprint 0 level. The definition of done (acceptance test): I will know this is done by selecting the custom level and choosing the number of numbers and its range. 
User Story logging activities: The Story: As a player, I want to see how many minutes I spent on each level so I can analyze my performance. The definition of done (acceptance test): I will know this is done by starting a level and seeing my time and after I finish the level.
